Final project for MAE3230 - Intro. Fluid Mechanics. In this project, teams dissect a fluid machine and create a video explaining how it works and it's governing fluid mechanical concepts. My contribution included assisting with the physical disassembly of the device and performing calculations such as the hydrostatic pressure difference in the tank, the fluid velocity through the internal tubing, and the associated pressure losses throughout the system. I also presented these calculations in the final video, walking through the analysis and visuals to show how components contribute to the humidifier’s performance.
